                Evaluating where I was in life and where I wanted to go I realized that I needed to choose a career that would support the lifestyle I wanted to live. I wanted something that would value me for my skills and reward me comfortably. Something that allows me to work remotely so that I could fulfill my dreams of living nomadically in van life.  Something that would challenge my problem solving skills while enticing my desire to create! I realized that my options, although limited, were quite interesting respectively. Soon enough it became apparent that Web Development is definitely something that would allow me to maximize my freedom. It became the perfect solution that would allow me to invest in myself in the present and future!
